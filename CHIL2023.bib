sheds light on the origin of, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, rabies, and other such
zoonotic pathogens in humans. It enables epidemiologists, medical
professionals, and policymakers to curb existing epidemics and prevent
future ones promptly. In the family Coronaviridae (of which SARS-CoV-2
is a member), it is well-known that the spike protein is the point of
contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. On the other
hand, the two traditional mammalian orders, Carnivora (carnivores) and
Chiroptera (bats) are recognized to be responsible for maintaining and
spreading the Rabies Lyssavirus (RABV). We propose Virus2Vec, a
feature-vector representation for viral (nucleotide or amino acid)
sequences that enable vector-space-based machine learning models to
identify viral hosts. Virus2Vec generates numerical feature vectors
for unaligned sequences, allowing us to forego the computationally
expensive sequence alignment step from the pipeline. Virus2Vec
leverages the power of both the \emph{minimizer} and position weight
matrix (PWM) to generate compact feature vectors. Using several
classifiers, we empirically evaluate Virus2Vec on real-world spike
sequences of Coronaviridae and rabies virus sequence data to predict
the host (identifying the reservoirs of infection). Our results
demonstrate that Virus2Vec outperforms the predictive accuracies of
baseline and state-of-the-art methods.},

    abstract = {Learning multi-view data is an emerging problem in machine learning research, and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular dimensionality-reduction method for integrating information from multiple views. These views often provide not only consensus but also complementary information.
However, most multi-view NMF algorithms assign equal weight to each view or tune the weight via line search empirically, which can be infeasible without any prior knowledge of the views or computationally expensive. 
In this paper, we propose a weighted multi-view NMF (WM-NMF) algorithm.  In particular, we aim to address the critical technical gap, which is to learn both view-specific weight and observation-specific reconstruction weight to quantify each view’s information content. The introduced weighting scheme can alleviate unnecessary views' adverse effects and enlarge the positive effects of the important views by assigning smaller and larger weights, respectively. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of achieving better clustering performance and dealing with the noisy data compared to the existing algorithms.},

    abstract = {Only about one-third of the deaths worldwide are assigned a medically-certified cause, and understanding the causes of deaths occurring outside of medical facilities is logistically and financially challenging. Verbal autopsy (VA) is a routinely used tool to collect information on cause of death in such settings. VA is a survey-based method where a structured questionnaire is conducted to family members or caregivers of a recently deceased person, and the collected information is used to infer the cause of death. As VA becomes an increasingly routine tool for cause-of-death data collection, the lengthy questionnaire has become a major challenge to the implementation and scale-up of VA interviews as they are costly and time-consuming to conduct. In this paper, we propose a novel active questionnaire design approach that optimizes the order of the questions dynamically to achieve accurate cause-of-death assignment with the smallest number of questions. We propose a fully Bayesian strategy for adaptive question selection that is compatible with any existing probabilistic cause-of-death assignment methods. We also develop an early stopping criterion that fully accounts for the uncertainty in the model parameters. We also propose a penalized score to account for constraints and preferences of existing question structures. We evaluate the performance of our active designs using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating that the proposed strategy achieves accurate cause-of-death assignment using considerably fewer questions than the traditional static VA survey instruments.},

Modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in multivariate biosignals is challenging due to (1) long-range temporal dependencies and (2) complex spatial correlations between the electrodes. To address these challenges, we propose representing multivariate biosignals as time-dependent graphs and introduce \textsc{GraphS4mer}, a general graph neural network (GNN) architecture that improves performance on biosignal classification tasks by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in biosignals. Specifically, (1) we leverage the Structured State Space architecture, a state-of-the-art deep sequence model, to capture long-range temporal dependencies in biosignals and (2) we propose a graph structure learning layer in \textsc{GraphS4mer} to learn dynamically evolving graph structures in the data.  We evaluate our proposed model on three distinct biosignal classification tasks and show that \textsc{GraphS4mer} consistently improves over existing models, including (1) seizure detection from electroencephalographic signals, outperforming a previous GNN with self-supervised pre-training by 3.1 points in AUROC; (2) sleep staging from polysomnographic signals, a 4.1 points improvement in macro-F1 score compared to existing sleep staging models; and (3) 12-lead electrocardiogram classification, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 2.7 points in macro-F1 score.},

    abstract = {Imbalanced token distributions naturally exist in text documents, leading neural language models to overfit on frequent tokens.
The token imbalance may dampen the robustness of radiology report generators, as complex medical terms appear less frequently but reflect more medical information. In this study, we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art models fail to generate infrequent tokens on two standard benchmark datasets (IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR) of radiology report generation. To solve the challenge, we propose the \textbf{T}oken \textbf{Im}balance Adapt\textbf{er} (\textit{TIMER}), aiming to improve generation robustness on infrequent tokens. The model automatically leverages token imbalance by an unlikelihood loss and dynamically optimizes generation processes to augment infrequent tokens.  We compare our approach with multiple state-of-the-art methods on the two benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model robustness overall and infrequent tokens. Our ablation analysis shows that our reinforcement learning method has a major effect in adapting token imbalance for radiology report generation.

RGC can be used as a pre-training dataset or a new benchmark for medical report generation and medical image-text retrieval.

    abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that allows the model trainer to access more data samples by training across multiple decentralized data sources while enforcing data access constraints. Such trained models can achieve significantly higher performance beyond what can be done when trained on a single data source. In a FL setting, none of the training data is ever transmitted to any central location; i.e.\ sensitive data remains local and private. These characteristics make FL perfectly suited for applications in healthcare, where a variety of compliance constraints restrict how data may be handled. Despite these apparent benefits in compliance and privacy, certain scenarios such as heterogeneity of the local data distributions pose significant challenges for FL. Such challenges are even more pronounced in the case of a multilingual setting. This paper presents a FL system for pre-training a large-scale multi-lingual model suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks such as medical entity tagging. Our work represents one of the first such production-scale systems, capable of training across multiple highly heterogeneous data providers, and achieving levels of accuracy that could not be otherwise achieved by using central training with public data only. We also show that the global model performance can be further improved by a local training step.},

Previous research, however, does not provide a practical guide to applying FL in the medical domain. We propose empirical benchmarks and experimental settings for three representative medical datasets with different modalities: longitudinal electronic health records, skin cancer images, and electrocardiogram signals. The likely users of FL such as medical institutions and IT companies can take these benchmarks as guides for adopting FL and minimize their trial and error. For each dataset, each client data is from a different source to preserve real-world heterogeneity. We evaluate six FL algorithms designed for addressing data heterogeneity among clients, and a hybrid algorithm combining the strengths of two representative FL algorithms. Based on experiment results from three modalities, we discover that simple FL algorithms tend to outperform more sophisticated ones, while the hybrid algorithm consistently shows good, if not the best performance. We also find that a frequent global model update leads to better performance under a fixed training iteration budget. As the number of participating clients increases, higher cost is incurred due to increased IT administrators and GPUs, but the performance consistently increases. We expect future users will refer to these empirical benchmarks to design the FL experiments in the medical domain considering their clinical tasks and obtain stronger performance with lower costs.},

A few voices active in the medical AI space have expressed concerns on the reliability of Explainable AI techniques and especially feature attribution methods, questioning their use and inclusion in guidelines and standards. We characterize the problem as a lack of semantic match between explanations and human understanding. To understand when feature importance can be used reliably, we introduce a distinction between feature importance of low- and high-level features. We argue that for data types where low-level features come endowed with a clear semantics, such as tabular data like Electronic Health Records, semantic match can be obtained, and thus feature attribution methods can still be employed in a meaningful and useful way. For high-level features, we sketch a procedure to test whether semantic match has been achieved.},

    abstract = {Detailed mobile sensing data from phones and fitness trackers offer an opportunity to quantify previously unmeasurable behavioral changes to improve individual health and accelerate responses to emerging diseases. Unlike in natural language processing and computer vision, deep learning has yet to broadly impact this domain, in which the majority of research and clinical applications still rely on manually defined features or even forgo predictive modeling altogether due to insufficient accuracy. This is due to unique challenges in the behavioral health domain, including
very small datasets ($\sim \!\! 10^1$ participants), which frequently contain missing data, consist of long time series with critical long-range dependencies (length$<10^4$), and extreme class imbalances ($>10^3$:1). Here, we \new{describe} a neural architecture for multivariate time series classification designed to address these unique domain challenges. Our proposed behavioral representation learning approach combines novel tasks for self-supervised pretraining and transfer learning to address data scarcity,  and captures long-range dependencies across long-history time series through transformer self-attention following convolutional neural network-based dimensionality reduction. We propose an evaluation framework aimed at reflecting expected real-world performance in plausible deployment scenarios. Concretely, we demonstrate (1) performance improvements over baselines of up to 0.15 ROC AUC across five influenza-related prediction tasks, (2) transfer learning-induced performance improvements \new{including a 16\% relative increase} in PR AUC in small data scenarios, and (3) the potential of transfer learning in novel disease scenarios through an exploratory case study of zero-shot COVID-19 prediction in an independent data set.

    abstract = {Machine learning models for healthcare commonly use binary indicator variables to represent the diagnosis of specific health conditions in medical records. However, in populations with significant under-reporting, the absence of a recorded diagnosis does not rule out the presence of a condition, making it difficult to distinguish between negative and missing values. This effect,  which we refer to as latent missingness, may lead to model degradation and perpetuate existing biases in healthcare. To address this issue, we propose that healthcare providers and payers  allocate a budget towards data collection (eg. subsidies for check-ups or lab tests). However, given finite resources, only a subset of data points can be collected. Additionally, most models are unable to be re-trained after deployment. In this paper, we propose a method for efficient data collection in order to maximize a fixed model's performance on a given population.

Then, we construct a meta-algorithm to perform a retrospective scan for temporal shift on a large collection of tasks.

We found that hierarchically structured Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) often outperforms the state-of-the-art model on diverse tasks such as reconstruction, prediction, and generation, even with fewer parameters and less training time.
Moreover, it turns out that making use of the inherent hierarchy of EHR data can boost the performance of any kind of backbone models and clinical tasks performed.

    abstract = {Fair calibration is a widely desirable fairness criteria in risk prediction contexts. 
One way to measure and achieve fair calibration is with multicalibration. 
Multicalibration constrains calibration error among flexibly-defined subpopulations while maintaining overall calibration. 
However, multicalibrated models can exhibit a higher percent calibration error among groups with lower base rates than groups with higher base rates. 
As a result, it is possible for a decision-maker to learn to trust or distrust model predictions for specific groups. 
To alleviate this, we propose \emph{proportional multicalibration}, a criteria that constrains the percent calibration error among groups and within prediction bins. 
We prove that satisfying proportional multicalibration bounds a model's multicalibration as well its \emph{differential calibration}, a fairness criteria that directly measures how closely a model approximates sufficiency. 
Therefore, proportionally calibrated models limit the ability of decision makers to distinguish between model performance on different patient groups, which may make the models more trustworthy in practice.  
We provide an efficient algorithm for post-processing risk prediction models for proportional multicalibration and evaluate it empirically. 
We conduct simulation studies and investigate a real-world application of PMC-postprocessing to prediction of emergency department patient admissions.
We observe that proportional multicalibration is a promising criteria for controlling simultaneous measures of calibration fairness of a model over intersectional groups with virtually no cost in terms of classification performance.  }

Our approach combines key ideas from DAEs with co-teaching to iteratively filter and learn from clean patient-reported samples. Applied to the task of recovering carbohydrate values for blood glucose management in diabetes, our approach reduces noise (MSE) in patient-reported carbohydrates from 72$g^2$ (95\% CI: 54-93) to 18$g^2$ (13-25), outperforming the best baseline (33$g^2$ (27-43)).

    abstract = {Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a biosignal that contains valuable information for monitoring health conditions related to sympathetic nervous system activity. Analyzing ambulatory EDA data is challenging because EDA measurements tend to be noisy and sparsely labeled. To address this problem, we present the first study of contrastive learning that examines approaches that are tailored to the EDA signal. We present a novel set of data augmentations that are tailored to EDA, and use them to generate positive examples for unsupervised contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed approach on the downstream task of stress detection. We find that it outperforms baselines when used both for fine-tuning and for transfer learning, especially in regimes of high label sparsity. We verify that our novel EDA-specific augmentations add considerable value beyond those considered in prior work through a set of ablation experiments.},

    abstract = {High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, necessitating accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement. Clinicians measure BP with an invasive arterial catheter or via a non-invasive arm or finger cuff. However, the former can cause discomfort to the patient and is unsuitable outside Intensive Care Unit (ICU). While cuff-based devices, despite being non-invasive, fails to provide continuous measurement, and they measure from peripheral blood vessels whose BP waveforms differ significantly from those proximal to the heart. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a measurement protocol for converting easily measured non-invasive data into accurate BP values. Addressing this gap, we propose a non-invasive approach to predict BP from arterial area and blood flow velocity signals measured from a Philips ultrasound transducer (XL-143) applied to large arteries close to heart. We developed the protocol and collected data from 72 subjects. The shape of BP (relative BP) can be theoretically calculated from these waveforms, however there is no established theory to obtain \textit{absolute} BP values. To tackle this challenge, we further employ data-driven machine learning models to predict the Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP), from which the absolute BP can be derived. Our study investigates various machine learning algorithms to optimize the prediction accuracy. We find that LSTM, Transformer, and 1D-CNN algorithms using the blood pressure shape and blood flow velocity waveforms as inputs can achieve 8.6, 8.7, and 8.8 mmHg average standard deviation of the prediction error respectively without anthropometric data such as age, sex, heart rate, height, weight. Furthermore, the 1D-CNN model can achieve 7.9mmHg when anthropometric data is added as inputs, improving upon an anthropometric-only model of 9.5mmHg. This machine learning-based approach, capable of converting ultrasound data into MAP values, presents a promising software tool for physicians in clinical decision-making regarding blood pressure management.

    author = {Chen, George H},
	pages = {440-476},
    abstract = {We propose a general framework for visualizing any intermediate embedding representation used by any neural survival analysis model. Our framework is based on so-called \emph{anchor directions} in an embedding space. We show how to estimate these anchor directions using clustering or, alternatively, using user-supplied ``concepts'' defined by collections of raw inputs (e.g., feature vectors all from female patients could encode the concept ``female''). For tabular data, we present visualization strategies that reveal how anchor directions relate to raw clinical features and to survival time distributions. We then show how these visualization ideas extend to handling raw inputs that are images. Our framework is built on looking at angles between vectors in an embedding space, where there could be ``information loss'' by ignoring magnitude information. We show how this loss results in a ``clumping'' artifact that appears in our visualizations, and how to reduce this information loss in practice.},

	title = {Leveraging an Alignment Set in Tackling Instance-Dependent Label Noise},
    author = {Tjandra, Donna and Wiens, Jenna},
	pages = {477-497},
    abstract = {Noisy training labels can hurt model performance. Most approaches that aim to address label noise assume label noise is independent from the input features. In practice, however, label noise is often feature or \textit{instance-dependent}, and therefore biased (i.e., some instances are more likely to be mislabeled than others). E.g., in clinical care, female patients are more likely to be under-diagnosed for cardiovascular disease compared to male patients. Approaches that ignore this dependence can produce models with poor discriminative performance, and in many healthcare settings, can exacerbate issues around health disparities. In light of these limitations, we propose a two-stage approach to learn in the presence instance-dependent label noise. Our approach utilizes \textit{\anchor points}, a small subset of data for which we know the observed and ground truth labels. On several tasks, our approach leads to consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art in discriminative performance (AUROC) while mitigating bias (area under the equalized odds curve, AUEOC). For example, when predicting acute respiratory failure onset on the MIMIC-III dataset, our approach achieves a harmonic mean (AUROC and AUEOC) of 0.84 (SD [standard deviation] 0.01) while that of the next best baseline is 0.81 (SD 0.01).  Overall, our approach improves accuracy while mitigating potential bias compared to existing approaches in the presence of instance-dependent label noise.},

This work proposes the Evaluation on Medical Datasets Over Time (EMDOT) framework,

Inspired by the concept of backtesting, 
EMDOT simulates possible training procedures that practitioners 
might have been able to execute at each point in time
and evaluates the resulting models on all future time points. 
Evaluating both linear and more complex models on six distinct medical data sources (tabular and imaging), we

show how depending on the dataset, 
using all historical data may be ideal in many cases, 
whereas using a window of the most recent data could be advantageous in others. 
In datasets

where models suffer from sudden degradations in performance,
we investigate plausible explanations for these shocks.
We release the EMDOT package to help facilitate 
further works in deployment-oriented evaluation over time.},

	pages = {509-525},
    abstract = {The analysis of multivariate time series data is challenging due to the various frequencies of signal changes that can occur over both short and long terms. Furthermore, standard deep learning models are often unsuitable for such datasets, as signals are typically sampled at different rates. To address these issues, we introduce MultiWave, a novel framework that enhances deep learning time series models by incorporating components that operate at the intrinsic frequencies of signals. MultiWave uses wavelets to decompose each signal into subsignals of varying frequencies and groups them into frequency bands. Each frequency band is handled by a different component of our model. A gating mechanism combines the output of the components to produce sparse models that use only specific signals at specific frequencies. Our experiments demonstrate that MultiWave accurately identifies informative frequency bands and improves the performance of various deep learning models, including LSTM, Transformer, and CNN-based models, for a wide range of applications. It attains top performance in stress and affect detection from wearables. It also increases the AUC of the best-performing model by 5\% for in-hospital COVID-19 mortality prediction from patient blood samples and for human activity recognition from accelerometer and gyroscope data. We show that MultiWave consistently identifies critical features and their frequency components, thus providing valuable insights into the applications studied.},

    abstract = {The human brain is the central hub of the neurobiological system, controlling behavior and cognition in complex ways. Recent advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging analysis have shown a growing interest in the interactions between brain regions of interest (ROIs) and their impact on neural development and disorder diagnosis. As a powerful deep model for analyzing graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied for brain network analysis. However, training deep models requires large amounts of labeled data, which is often scarce in brain network datasets due to the complexities of data acquisition and sharing restrictions. 
To make the most out of available training data, we propose \ours, a GNN pre-training framework that captures intrinsic brain network structures, regardless of clinical outcomes, and is easily adaptable to various downstream tasks. \ours comprises two key components: (1) an unsupervised pre-training technique designed specifically for brain networks, which enables learning from large-scale datasets without task-specific labels; (2) a data-driven parcellation atlas mapping pipeline that facilitates knowledge transfer across datasets with different ROI systems.
Extensive evaluations using various GNN models have demonstrated the robust and superior performance of \ours compared to baseline methods.},

    abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) affects over 530 million people globally and is often difficult to manage leading to serious health complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can help people with T2D to monitor and manage the disease. CGM devices sample an individual's glucose level at frequent intervals enabling sophisticated characterization of an individual's health. In this work, we leverage a large dataset of CGM data (5,447 individuals and 940,663 days of data) paired with health records and activity data to investigate how glucose levels in people with T2D are affected by external factors like weather conditions, extreme weather events, and temporal events including local holidays. We find temperature (p=$2.37\times10^{-8}$, n=3561), holidays (p=$2.23\times10^{-46}$, n=4079), and weekends (p=$7.64\times10^{-124}$, n=5429) each have a significant effect on standard glycemic metrics at a population level. Moreover, we show that we can predict whether an individual will be significantly affected by a (potentially unobserved) external event using only demographic information and a few days of CGM and activity data. Using random forest classifiers, we can predict whether an individual will be more negatively affected than a typical individual with T2D by a given external factor with respect to a given glycemic metric. We find performance (measured as ROC-AUC) is consistently above chance (across classifiers, median ROC-AUC=0.63). Performance is highest for classifiers predicting the effect of time-in-range (median ROC-AUC=0.70). These are important findings because they may enable better patient care management with day-to-day risk assessments based on external factors as well as improve algorithm development by reducing train- and test-time bias due to external factors.},

\textit{How can the decision of an ML model be explained to a physician?} 
The explanations considered in this paper are counterfactuals (CFs), hypothetical scenarios that would have resulted in the opposite outcome. Specifically, time-series CFs are investigated, inspired by the way physicians converse and reason out decisions `I would have given the patient a vasopressor if their blood pressure was lower and falling'. 
Key properties of CFs that are particularly meaningful in clinical settings are outlined: physiological plausibility, relevance to the task and sparse perturbations. 
Past work on CF generation does not satisfy these properties, specifically plausibility in that realistic time-series CFs are not generated.
A variational autoencoder (VAE)-based approach is proposed that captures these desired properties.
The method produces CFs that improve on prior approaches quantitatively (more plausible CFs as evaluated by their likelihood w.r.t original data distribution, and 100$\times$ faster at generating CFs)
and qualitatively (2$\times$ more plausible and relevant) 
as evaluated by three physicians.},

Recent results have suggested that LLMs encode a surprising amount of medical knowledge. 
This raises an important question regarding the utility of smaller domain-specific language models.
With the success of general-domain LLMs, is there still a need for specialized clinical models? 
To investigate this question, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of 12 language models, ranging from 220M to 175B parameters, measuring their performance on 3 different clinical tasks that test their ability to parse and reason over electronic health records.
As part of our experiments, we train T5-Base and T5-Large models from scratch on clinical notes from MIMIC III and IV to directly investigate the efficiency of clinical tokens.
We show that relatively small specialized clinical models substantially outperform all in-context learning approaches, even when finetuned on limited annotated data. 
Further, we find that pretraining on clinical tokens allows for smaller, more parameter-efficient models that either match or outperform much larger language models trained on general text.
